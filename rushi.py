Analyze the expressions of the person speaking in these video frames.
Provide a detailed analysis based on the following parameters:
1.  **Confidence:** Does the person appear confident and self-assured? Look for signs like a steady gaze, relaxed facial muscles, and genuine smiles.
2.  **Engagement:** How well does the person connect with the viewer through their expressions? Are they making eye contact (towards the camera)? Do their expressions seem authentic and engaging?
3.  **Emotional Expression:** What emotions are being conveyed? Are they appropriate for the context of someone speaking/presenting? Is there a good range of expression, or is it monotonous?
4.  **Clarity of Expression:** Are the expressions clear and easy to interpret, or are they ambiguous?

After your detailed analysis, provide a final judgment and a score out of 100 for their overall expressiveness and presentation skills based on these visual cues. Structure your response with the detailed analysis first, followed by the final score."""
